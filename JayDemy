Q 01: An Nginx Deploy named nginx-static is Running in the nginx-static NS, It is configured using a cfgmap named nginx-config. update the nginx-config cfgMap
to allow only TLSv1.3 connections.re-create , restart or scale resources as necessary, By using command to test the changes:

Question 02: Migrate an existing web application from ingress to Gateway API, We must maintain HTTPSaccess.

ingress resource named web.
Next, create an HTTPRoute named web-route with hostname gateway.web.k8s.local that maintains the existing routing rules from the current ingress resource 
named web.  

question 03: Create a new Horizontal POD Autoscaler( HPA) named apache-server in the autoscale namespace, This HPA must target the existing Depoyment called 
apache-server in the autoscale namespace.  
set the HPA to atrget for 50% CPU usage per pod, Configure hpa to have at min 1 pod and no more than 4 pods[max]. Also we have to set the downscale 
stabilization window to 30 seconds.
